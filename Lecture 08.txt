Lecture 08
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 8 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
Why are semaphores so popular?
Why is popen(2) treated differently on different programming languages?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- Semaphores, shared memory, and message queues use the kernel to have IPC
- Semaphores are not reliable since they rely on outside processes
- Shared memory is super fast since it resides in memory
