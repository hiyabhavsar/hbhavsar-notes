Lecture 09
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 9 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
What is the difference between multi processing and multi threading?
Do semaphores need to be used for multi processing?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- Raw sockets require super user privileges
- To read and write on a socket you would need to use binding
	-Can be used as a rendezvous point for unrelated and related processes
- Multi processing creates separate processes that have a copy of all data
	-There is no shared data since the processes are forked
- Multi threading creates separate threads for the processes, there is some data that is shared so a semaphore or other concurrency tools may be required
