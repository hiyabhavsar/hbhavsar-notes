Lecture 07
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 7 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
Why does the reentrant.c program run differently on Ubuntu and NetBSD?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- Every process has a process id, belong to the login session, and have their own process group
- If the session leader is terminated all the process in that session will also be terminated
- Signals are asynchronous events and allow for interprocess communication
