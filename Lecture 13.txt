Lecture 13
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 13 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
How should the CGI environment be set up?
Why are secure levels not widely used if they are so secure?
Are there alternative methods for security besides secure levels?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- The GET function logic
- CGI environment variables
- Restricting super users could be done with file flags (used as a security precaution so superusers do not have access to everything)
- Secure levels are set during rebooting which prevents an attacker from changing privileges and having root access if they have remote access. 
Attacker would need to reboot the system to change privileges and permissions
