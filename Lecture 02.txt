Lecture 02
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 2 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.
Completed the file descriptor exercise within the weekly checkpoint.

Open questions:
Why do certain commands run differently between different Unix systems?


After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- Different limits for opening a file for user and a process
- 3 file descriptors are always open: stdin, stdout, stderr
- As a regular user, you cannot raise the limit because if a user was able to raise the limit then the user could use all the resources
