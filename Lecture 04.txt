Lecture 04
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 4 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
What is FTS and how does it work?
How were people able to discover a leap second?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- Fts_open(): to open the file hierarchy
- Fts_read(): read the file hierarchy
- Fts_child(): list of entries underneath the current entry
	- Pointer to a linked list with all the entries
- _ftsent: information about location within hierarchy and the stat library
- It is important that all saved passwords are hashed and not encrypted since hashing is a one way operation
