Lecture 06
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 6 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
What is the difference between exit() and _exit and when do you use each?
Is there a way to keep track of child PIDs when fork is called?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- Can't change the memory locations on the stack due to the stack only being either readable or executable; will not be both at the same time
- If exit(0) than exit function is used and the exit system call is used
- If _exit than you immediately exit and the output is not flushed 
- Need to keep track of child PIDs when fork is called, no way of knowing child pid after fork has been called
