Lecture 11
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 11 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
How many machine architectures aer there on NetBSD and how do you find them?
Program is not correctly compiling. How should we fix it?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- Add #indef and #def to fix multiple server variable issues
- In a dynamically linked file, the program has to get information from different files to link (dlopen() is used to link files at runtime)
- There are 119 e_machines
