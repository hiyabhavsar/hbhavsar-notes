Lecture 05
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 5 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
What is a Whiteout file?
How does the program pointer.c work when ran with ./a.out foo?

After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- For question 5 in weekly checkpoint:
	- Overflowed argv[0] buffer by using the strcat and it overflowed the null byte into the argv[1] string thus printing a blank
