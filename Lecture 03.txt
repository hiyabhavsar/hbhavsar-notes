Lecture 03
==========

Before class:
-------------
I watched the week 3 lecture videos and completed the weekly checkpoint.


Open questions:
What is the difference between files of type socket and network socket?


After class:
------------
Important take-away:
- In order to identify if two files are the same then compare the i-node numbers and device number for the filesystem
- In order to remove a file from a directory, the user must have write and execute permissions on the directory in which the file is in
- File of type socket is a rendezvous point for interprocess communication (only have access from the system)
- Network socket is also a rendezvous point for interprocess communication but within the kernel space (do not have access control)
